RHINO PYTHON PROJECT
====================	


BACKGROUND
***********

This repository is aimed towards Rhinoceros3D  - CAD  modeling software.
Custom Python files and Grasshopper Scripts combined with Python files are included in this repository
These have potential application for Data Management, Geometry Data Management and Digital Fabrication Workflows using RhinoCommon API and Rhino.Python.

Note: There are also some grasshopper scripts / workflows which pairs with the Python Components or External Python files. 
Integration of recent Rhino Developments from McNeel team like Rhino Inside Revit, Rhino Compute,etc will also be demonstrated in the reposiotry


APPLICATION
***********

Architectural Geometry(SubAssembly Fabrication for Facades)- (In progress!)

Assembly Drawing Layout Templating and Drawing Automation

AutoDimensioning of 3D Geometry (In progress!)

DataStructure and Algorithms in Python Nanodegree Program (Udacity!)

Graph Based Workflows for Architectural Geometries (In progress!)

Point Cloud Processing for Reality Capture(In progress!)

File and Directory Workflows(In progress!)

(Will add more as I progress)
