BACKGROUND
***********

This repository is aimed towards Rhinoceros3D modeling Software
Custom Python Components and/or Grasshopper Scripts combined with Python are written, which have potential application for Data Management, Geometry Data Management
Digital Fabrication Workflows using RhinoCommon API. Note: There are also some grasshopper scripts / workflows which pairs with the Python Components or External Python files. Integration of recent RhinoSDK Development from McNeel team like Rhino Inside Revit, Rhino Compute,etc will also be demonstrated in the reposiotry
